In this implementation of the code I have replaced callback function by the async keyword on the function definition, and the callbacks are replaced by await statements. The try-catch block is used to handle errors and return appropriate error responses.

I have also used logic for getting the page and pageSize to a separate function so we can test it independently.

The '/rides' endpoint code is split into a functional and an imperative function (getPaginationParams and getRides), using which we can test them independently. By splitting the logic into smaller, independent functions, it becomes easier to test each part of the code and ensure that it is working correctly. It also makes the code more readable and maintainable.

To ensure that the system is not vulnerable to SQL injection, the db.all() method is used with placeholders ? for the dynamic parameters These placeholders act as a barrier against SQL injection attacks, as the user input is not directly inserted into the SQL query, but instead, it is passed as a separate parameter to the query. So, even if the user input contains malicious SQL code, it will not be executed as part of the query.
Few of the ways to prevent SQL injection are:
    Use parameterized queries
    Escape user input
    Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library

I have also made a simple HTML form that you can use to test the /rides endpoint using fetch() API. CORS can be avoided by using a web server on your local machine, and serving the HTML file using that web server. This way, the web page and the server will be on the same domain, and the browser will not block the requests. This can be achieved by using a live web server like the default server that comes with the python standard library (python -m http.server).

You can also use cURL to test the server as follows
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
        "start_lat": 32.788022,
        "start_long": -132.399797,
        "end_lat": 37.783472,
        "end_long": -124.398475,
        "rider_name": "Sam Smith",
        "driver_name": "Jane Doe",
        "driver_vehicle": "Tesla S"
    }' http://localhost:8010/rides
